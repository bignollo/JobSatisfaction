# Job Satisfaction Analysis based on stack overflow survey

The [Medium Post.ipynb](https://github.com/bignollo/JobSatisfaction/blob/main/Medium%20Post.ipynb) notebooks aims to analyze the data from 2017 Stack Overflow survey on Job Satisfation.
Mostly focusing on Gender and region posible bias, the notebook generate charts and small set of analysis in order to identify trends that can be an indicator of bias.

* Medium Post.ipynb - Jupyter noteboook with the analysis of the data.

* survey-results-public.csv - Stack overflow 2017 survey results
* survey_results_schema.csv - Stack overflow 2017 survey results' Schema


Based on the data available and our analysis we can conclude:

* Job Satisfaction is nor really tied to Salary nor Country
* Gender is not playing a huge role on salary on any of the regions
* Job Satisfaction has a relationship to formal education, but more data is needed to conclude the strength of this relationship.

We need to keep in mind that the quality of the data can not be guarantee due to the nature of the survey, more official sources would be great in order to have more precise insights.
